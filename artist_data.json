The Roman copies of Greek paintings also provide valuable information, since they greatly appreciate Greek techniques and styles, copying and reproducing them.\\n\\nThe most common and respected form of art, according to authors like Pliny or Pausanias, were panel paintings, individual, portable paintings on wood boards. The techniques used were encaustic (wax) painting and tempera. Such paintings normally depicted figural scenes, including portraits and still-lifes. Unfortunately, due to the perishable nature of the materials used and the major upheavals at the end of antiquity, not one of the famous works of Greek panel painting has survived, nor even any of the copies that doubtlessly existed, and which give us most of our knowledge of Greek sculpture. We have slightly more significant survivals of mural compositions. The most important surviving Greek examples from before the Roman period are the fairly low-quality Pitsa panels (c. 530 BC), and the Tomb of the Diver from Paestum (c.470 BC). The tradition of wall painting in Greece goes back at least to the Minoan and Mycenaean Bronze Age, with the lavish fresco decoration of sites like Knossos, Tiryns and Mycenae. It is not clear, whether there is any continuity between these antecedents and later Greek wall paintings.\\n\\nMost Greek sculptures were painted in strong and bright colors; this aspect of Greek stonework is described as polychromy. The paint was frequently limited to parts depicting clothing, hair, and so on, with the skin left in the natural color of the stone or bronze, but it could also cover sculptures in their totality; female skin in marble tended to be uncoloured, while male skin might be a light brown. The painting of Greek sculpture should not merely be seen as an enhancement of their sculpted form, but has the characteristics of a distinct style of art. Basing on micropigment remains on greek relief and sculptures, it have been possible to obtain a representation on how they must have been look like in ancient times\", \"birth_date\": \"c.700 BC\",

He married and became the father of three daughters. 2004 he left Germany and settled in Linz, Austria.\\n\\nFrom1990 to 2013 Gazmend attended courses in oil portrait painting at various academies. 2013 he began to study figure drawing at the University of Linz with Professor Anneliese Oberdanner, a well-known expert in her field.\\n\\nHis work is traditional in nature and is centered on autobiographical elements, landscapes from the country of his birth, memories from his childhood, nudes and figure drawings, portraits and still lifes.
