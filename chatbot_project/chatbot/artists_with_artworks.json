            "description": "Article\n\nVery little is known of the Greek painters in ancient times, however, it is well know the mastery they could reach, by descriptions of some Roman writers. The Roman copies of Greek paintings also provide valuable information, since they greatly appreciate Greek techniques and styles, copying and reproducing them.\n\nThe most common and respected form of art, according to authors like Pliny or Pausanias, were panel paintings, individual, portable paintings on wood boards. The techniques used were encaustic (wax) painting and tempera. Such paintings normally depicted figural scenes, including portraits and still-lifes. Unfortunately, due to the perishable nature of the materials used and the major upheavals at the end of antiquity, not one of the famous works of Greek panel painting has survived, nor even any of the copies that doubtlessly existed, and which give us most of our knowledge of Greek sculpture. We have slightly more significant survivals of mural compositions. The most important surviving Greek examples from before the Roman period are the fairly low-quality Pitsa panels (c. 530 BC), and the Tomb of the Diver from Paestum (c.470 BC). The tradition of wall painting in Greece goes back at least to the Minoan and Mycenaean Bronze Age, with the lavish fresco decoration of sites like Knossos, Tiryns and Mycenae. It is not clear, whether there is any continuity between these antecedents and later Greek wall paintings.\n\nMost Greek sculptures were painted in strong and bright colors; this aspect of Greek stonework is described as polychromy. The paint was frequently limited to parts depicting clothing, hair, and so on, with the skin left in the natural color of the stone or bronze, but it could also cover sculptures in their totality; female skin in marble tended to be uncoloured, while male skin might be a light brown. The painting of Greek sculpture should not merely be seen as an enhancement of their sculpted form, but has the characteristics of a distinct style of art. Basing on micropigment remains on greek relief and sculptures, it have been possible to obtain a representation on how they must have been look like in ancient times",

            "description": "Article\nReferences\n\nGazmend Freitag was born on 25 May 1968 in Pata\u00e7ani i Posht\u00ebm, Kosovo. Even as a child Gazmend demonstrated a talent for drawing and devoted himself to literature.\n\nAfter graduation in 1987 Gazmend started studying law in Pristina. After two semesters at the University of Pristina access was closed to Albanians by the Serbian authorities. Student protests followed in 1989. Some participants paid with their lives while others were arrested or prosecuted, among them Gazmend, who saw himself forced to emigrate from Kosovo.\n\nIn Germany he sought an artist's life. He married and became the father of three daughters. 2004 he left Germany and settled in Linz, Austria.\n\nFrom1990 to 2013 Gazmend attended courses in oil portrait painting at various academies. 2013 he began to study figure drawing at the University of Linz with Professor Anneliese Oberdanner, a well-known expert in her field.\n\nHis work is traditional in nature and is centered on autobiographical elements, landscapes from the country of his birth, memories from his childhood, nudes and figure drawings, portraits and still lifes. He prefers drawing with pencils, chalk and ink as well as oil paintings on canvas.\n\nStrong brushwork and vibrant colors are the hallmark of his paintings. Much of his work is centered upon \u201cbeautiful moments\u201d in the tradition of Classical Modernism, with a focus on the European Impressionists.\n\nOn canvas, particularly with portraits, he conveys the emotions drawn from the observation of his surroundings and introduces new stylistic dimensions. In addition he offers his reconstruction of reality and underlines with emphasis the facial peculiarities of his portraits. His composition syntax follows the Rules of Art and is completed with romantic considerations.\n\nThe art of Gazmend Freitag is deeply connected with the experience of the Kosovo-Albanian Diaspora and to having been driven from his homeland, a fate he shares with countless refugees of the present time. His biography is an example of the successful integration of a sensitive artist with a very positive view of life. Art as a means of communication is a central point of his work.\n\nSince 2004 he is living in Linz, Upper Austria. His work has been seen in Austrian and International exhibitions and art fairs",
